You'll notice I'm not worrying about validation in this guide because it's a simple enough example and this post is concentrating on the nested forms and many-to-many associations.

You should be familiar with what you see here, I've used through: as this is recommended in the documentation as we have extra fields we want to access on the pivot table.
